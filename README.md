# haskell-binary-Balanced-Binary-SearchTrees
Implementation of 10 functions associated with manipulating binary trees, balanced binary trees, and binary search trees.

Three of the operations (memberBST, insertBST and deleteBST) require you to implement the associated operations "in time proportional to the height of the tree."  This means you must use one of the tree-based recursive implementations of these operations; examples (but not the only approach) may be found here:
